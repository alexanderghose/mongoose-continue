To practice forms, you are going to create a simple contact form, that may look like this:

# Requirements

1. Create a webserver that delivers a form to your user.
2. When your user submits this form, they will see a simple page that thanks them for their submission, and displays the data that they have just submitted.
3. (optional) Store this data into a database
4. (optional) Email this form data to yourself using the ```nodemailer``` module.

## This lab is a deliverable.

As usual, please push your code to git, and place a link in your deliverables file.
